# Cyber-Security-Tool
Cyber Security Tool for Computer Science Final Year Project Implementation

**Downloading and Adding Browser Extension**

Unfortunately, due to the costs, maintenance and required verifications associated with publishing a Browser Extension to the Browser Extension Stores, this was not possible as part of this project. Therefore, this README will give detailed steps on installing, loading and initialising the Cyber Security Tool, so this can be tested and used. In the future, this would be updated to be included on the store.
