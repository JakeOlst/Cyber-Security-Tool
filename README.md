# Cyber-Security-Tool
Cyber Security Tool for Computer Science Final Year Project Implementation

**Downloading and Adding Browser Extension**

*Manual*

Prior to the completion of the project realisation stage, the Browser Extension was not published to the Extension store for the browsers, as this would require the updating of each of these each time a new fix was pushed. Additionally, this would require approval for each update during the realisation from the extension store. Therefore, this appendix entry will detail how the Cyber Security Tool browser extension can be loaded into different Web Browsers.
