                        <p> Social engineering is a tactic used by cybercriminals to manipulate and deceive individuals into divulging sensitive information or taking specific actions. It relies on psychological manipulation rather than technical exploits. </p>

                        <p> 
                            Safeguard yourself from social engineering attacks with these precautions:
                            <ol>
                                <li> Be cautious with unsolicited communications. </li>
                                <p>
                                    Avoid responding to unexpected emails, messages, or phone calls, especially if they request sensitive information or urgent actions.
                                </p>
                                <li> Verify the identity of the communicator. </li>
                                <p>
                                    Double-check the identity of individuals requesting information or actions. Contact the organization directly using trusted contact information to confirm.
                                </p>
                                <li> Educate yourself about common social engineering tactics. </li>
                                <p>
                                    Stay informed about manipulation techniques, such as phishing emails, pretexting, and baiting, to recognize and avoid falling victim to them.
                                </p>
                                <li> Think twice before sharing personal information. </li>
                                <p>
                                    Refrain from sharing sensitive details unless absolutely necessary, and ensure you are interacting with a legitimate and trusted entity.

                        <p> Social Engineering is a deceptive technique where cybercriminals manipulate individuals into divulging sensitive information. Let's delve into a real-life scenario involving Social Engineering. </p>
                        <p>
                            Imagine you receive a phone call from someone claiming to be from a trusted organization, perhaps your bank.
                            The caller informs you about a security issue and requests your personal details to verify your identity.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> The caller convincingly poses as a representative of your trusted organization. </li>
                            <li> They use persuasive tactics, instilling a sense of trust and urgency. </li>
                            <li> Unfortunately, you end up sharing sensitive information with the attacker. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Social Engineers employ psychological tactics to trick individuals:
                            <ol>
                                <li> The caller adopts a persona that seems trustworthy, such as posing as a bank representative. </li>
                                <li> They use psychological pressure and urgency to convince you to reveal personal information. </li>
                                <li> Falling victim, you unwittingly share sensitive details, which can lead to various threats. </li>
                            </ol>
