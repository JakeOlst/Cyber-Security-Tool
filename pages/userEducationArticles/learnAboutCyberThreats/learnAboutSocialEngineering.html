                    <p> 
                        Safeguard yourself from social engineering attacks with these precautions:
                        <ol>
                            <li> Be cautious with unsolicited communications. </li>
                            <p>
                                Avoid responding to unexpected emails, messages, or phone calls, especially if they request sensitive information or urgent actions.
                            </p>
                            <li> Verify the identity of the communicator. </li>
                            <p>
                                Double-check the identity of individuals requesting information or actions. Contact the organization directly using trusted contact information to confirm.
                            </p>
                            <li> Educate yourself about common social engineering tactics. </li>
                            <p>
                                Stay informed about manipulation techniques, such as phishing emails, pretexting, and baiting, to recognize and avoid falling victim to them.
                            </p>
                            <li> Think twice before sharing personal information. </li>
                            <p>

                    <p> Social Engineering is a deceptive technique where cybercriminals manipulate individuals into divulging sensitive information. Let's delve into a real-life scenario involving Social Engineering. </p>
                    <p>
                        Imagine you receive a phone call from someone claiming to be from a trusted organization, perhaps your bank.
                        The caller informs you about a security issue and requests your personal details to verify your identity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Social Engineers employ psychological tactics to trick individuals:

                            <li> The caller adopts a persona that seems trustworthy, such as posing as a bank representative. </li>
                            <li> They use psychological pressure and urgency to convince you to reveal personal information. </li>
                            <li> Falling victim, you unwittingly share sensitive details, which can lead to various threats. </li>
