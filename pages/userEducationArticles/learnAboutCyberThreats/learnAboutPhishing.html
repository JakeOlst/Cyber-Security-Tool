                        <p> Phishing is a method criminals use to steal personal information, such as credit card information. 
                            This is done by pretending to be someone you trust, such as a friend or a bank. 
                        </p>

                        <p> 
                            There are many steps you can take to prevent Phishing. These include:
                            <ol>
                                <li> When using the internet, be sure to check the web address and website name to be sure you are on the correct website. </li>
                                <li> Be sure to only click on emails and links which you fully trust. </li>
                                <li> Check for spelling and grammar mistakes in emails, as well as threatening language, as these often point towards a scam / phishing attempt. </li>
                                <li> Double check and verify requests for sensitive information. 'Real' organisations will rarely ask for details such as passwords. </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>

                        <p> 
                            While the purpose of phishing stays the same, there are many forms of this which can be taken. These include:
                        </p>
                        <ol>

                                    <p>
                                        Criminals send emails which look like real emails, such as a bank, service provider or social media provider. 
                                        If the user clicks on this and enters their information, this can be used maliciously. 
                                    </p>
                                    <li> "Spoofed" Emails </li>
                                    <p>
                                        'Spoofing' is where someone pretends to be someone else to obtain something. 
                                        Email 'Spoofing' may involve a criminal making the 'sender' email address of their email into something else. 
                                        For example, if a criminal changes their email address to appear to be from a legitimate company, such as a bank.
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                        'Vishing' is where criminals can contact people over the phone pretenting to be real companies, and request personal information. 
                                        Often, scare tactics are used for this, as well as pressuring, to have people make fast decisions over the phone. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p> 
                                        Criminals may change the caller ID appearance to appear as, and pretend to be, a trusted individual. 
                                        This increases the likelihood of an individual answering the phone, often leading to them making bad decisions.
                                    </p>

                                        When opening a malicious website, a pop-up may appear, telling you that there is something wrong with your computer or security. 
                                        Typically, it then requests for you to either call them on a number, or to download something.

                                        'Smishing' is a combination of 'SMS' and 'Phishing'.
                                        This is where a criminal will send a SMS (text message) to appear to be from a legitimate source. 
                                        This may have the user call a number, click a link or provide information.

                                        Social Engineering is where a criminal will pressure someone into providing information through manipulation. 
                                        This may involve deceiving someone into revealing personal or confidential information.

                                        'Spoofing' is where someone pretends to be someone else to obtain something. 
                                        Website 'Spoofing' involves a criminal making or changing their website to pretend to be another website. 
                                        For example, a criminal making their website look like eBay to have people input payment information.

                        <p> Let's delve into a common online threat called Phishing, where cybercriminals attempt to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. </p>
                        <p>
                            Imagine receiving an email that appears to be from your bank, alerting you to suspicious activity that requires immediate attention.
                            As you scrutinize the email, take note that it:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Displays the bank's logo, fostering a false sense of trustworthiness. </li>
                            <li> Addresses you by your full name, adding a personal touch to the deception. </li>
                            <li> Contains no noticeable spelling or grammatical errors, enhancing its believability. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Trusting the email's legitimacy, you click on the embedded link and arrive at a website that convincingly mimics your bank's official site.
                            However, this is a Phishing attack. Your entered details now reside in the hands of cybercriminals.
                        </p>
                        <h1> How did they manipulate you into clicking on this email? </h1>
                        <p>
                            Cybercriminals employ various tactics to make their phishing attempts appear genuine:
                            <ol>
                                <li> The email seems authentic, addressing you by your full name and featuring the bank's logo. </li>
                                <li> The email induces a sense of urgency, claiming immediate attention is needed for your account. </li>
                                <li> Clicking on the link takes you to a website that convincingly replicates your bank's official site. </li>
                                <li> Unbeknownst to you, entering your details provides the criminal with sensitive information. </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Stay calm and follow these steps to mitigate the impact:
                            <ol>
                                <li> Change any passwords you may have disclosed to the scammer. </li>
                                <li> Contact your bank through a trusted method to report the incident and seek guidance. </li>
                                <li> Don't hesitate to share your experience with someone you trust and seek assistance if needed. </li>
                                <li> Vigilantly monitor your accounts for any suspicious activity and promptly report it. </li>
                            </ol>

                            Defending against phishing attacks is crucial. Follow these steps to avoid falling victim to phishing scams:
                            <ul>
                                <li> Verify the legitimacy of emails. </li>

                                    Confirm that emails are from genuine sources, especially if they request personal information. Reach out to the company directly using trusted contact information.
                                </p>
                                <li> Watch for Warning Signs. </li>
                                <p>
                                    Be cautious of emails with spelling or grammar errors, urgent requests, or unexpected attachments. These could be indications of phishing attempts.
                                </p>
                                <li> Hover over links before clicking. </li>
                                <p>
                                    Before clicking on any links, hover your mouse over them to preview the destination URL. Avoid clicking on links that look suspicious or direct you to unfamiliar websites.
                                </p>
                                <li> Verify Requests for Sensitive Information. </li>
