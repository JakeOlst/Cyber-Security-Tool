                            There are many steps you can take to prevent Identity Theft. These include:
                            <ol>
                                <li> When using the internet, be sure to check the web address and website name to be sure you are on the correct website. </li>
                                <li> Be sure to only click on emails and links which you fully trust. </li>
                                <li> Check for spelling and grammar mistakes in emails, as well as threatening language, as these often point towards a scam / phishing attempt. </li>
                                <li> Double check and verify requests for sensitive information. 'Real' organisations will rarely ask for details such as passwords. </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>

                        <h1> Common Techniques of Phishing </h1>
                        <p> 
                            While the purpose of phishing stays the same, there are many forms of this which can be taken. These include:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> Email Phishing
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Deceptive Emails </li>
                                    <p>
                                        Criminals send emails which look like real emails, such as a bank, service provider or social media provider. 
                                        If the user clicks on this and enters their information, this can be used maliciously. 
                                    </p>
                                    <li> "Spoofed" Emails </li>
                                    <p>
                                        'Spoofing' is where someone pretends to be someone else to obtain something. 
                                        Email 'Spoofing' may involve a criminal making the 'sender' email address of their email into something else. 
                                        For example, if a criminal changes their email address to appear to be from a legitimate company, such as a bank.
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li> Vishing (Voice Phishing)
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Phone Calls </li>
                                    <p> 
                                        'Vishing' is where criminals can contact people over the phone pretenting to be real companies, and request personal information. 
                                        Often, scare tactics are used for this, as well as pressuring, to have people make fast decisions over the phone. 
                                    </p>
                                    <li> Caller Impersonation </li>
                                    <p> 
                                        Criminals may change the caller ID appearance to appear as, and pretend to be, a trusted individual. 
                                        This increases the likelihood of an individual answering the phone, often leading to them making bad decisions.
                                    </p>
                                </ul>

                            <li> Pop-up Phishing

                                    <p>
                                        When opening a malicious website, a pop-up may appear, telling you that there is something wrong with your computer or security. 
                                        Typically, it then requests for you to either call them on a number, or to download something.
                                    </p>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li> Smishing (SMS Phishing)
                                <ul>
                                    <p>
                                        'Smishing' is a combination of 'SMS' and 'Phishing'.
                                        This is where a criminal will send a SMS (text message) to appear to be from a legitimate source. 
                                        This may have the user call a number, click a link or provide information.
                                    </p>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li> Social Engineering Phishing
                                <ul>
                                    <p>
                                        Social Engineering is where a criminal will pressure someone into providing information through manipulation. 
                                        This may involve deceiving someone into revealing personal or confidential information.
                                    </p>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <p>
                                        'Spoofing' is where someone pretends to be someone else to obtain something. 
                                        Website 'Spoofing' involves a criminal making or changing their website to pretend to be another website. 
                                        For example, a criminal making their website look like eBay to have people input payment information.
                                    </p>
                                </ul>

                    <h1> Consequences of Phishing </h1>
                    <p> 
                        Phishing can have many consequences both physically, mentally and financially. Some examples of typical consequences include:
                        <ol>
                            <li> Loss of money, ranging from small amounts to very significant amounts. </li>
                            <li> Identity Theft. </li>
                            <li> Compromised / Locked accounts. </li>
                            <li> Emotional Distress and other Mental Health impacts. </li>
                            <li> Targeting for other threats. </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <h1> Example of a Phishing Attack </h1>
                    <p> An example of a Phishing Attack, and how this happens: </p>
                    <p>
                        Imagine that you receive an email which appears to be from your bank. 
                        This email says that there is suspicious activity within your account which requires immediate attention. 
                        You look at the email, and it:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Uses the logo of the bank. </li>
                        <li> Addresses you by your full name. </li>
                        <li> Doesn't have any spelling or grammatical mistakes. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, you click on the link within the email, and log into a website which looks like your Bank Website. 
                        However, this is a phishing attack. Once your details are entered, the criminal has these.
                    </p>
                    <h1> How did they manage to trick you into clicking on this link? </h1>
                    <p>
                        It is unfortunate, but criminals are very clever. They have learned how to make an email *look* legitimate. 
                        However, in this example, they managed to trick you by using these methods: 
                        <ol>
                            <li> The email looks to be legitimate, by addressing you by your full name, and by using the bank logo and language. </li>
                            <li> The email creates a sense of urgency - the account needs *immediate* attention. </li>
                            <li> When you clicked on the link, the website you were sent to looked like your bank website. </li>
                            <li> When you logged into what you thought was your bank, you actually gave a criminal your banking information. </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <h1> You believe that you were a victim of a phishing attack. What should you do next? </h1>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, try to stay calm. Phishing attacks are, unfortunately, very common, and banks are aware of them. 
                        In fact, when trying to log in, some banks require a code they text to you. If you believe you have given a criminal your details, you should: 
                        <ol>
                            <li> Change any passwords you may have given away. </li>
                            <li> Contact your Bank or Financial Institution using a trusted method, and discuss this with them. </li>
                            <li> Don't be ashamed or embarassed about telling someone, and seeking help if needed. </li>
                            <li> Keep an eye on your accounts, to be sure there is no suspicious behaviour. If there is, report it! </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <h1> How could we have avoided this? </h1>
                    <p>
                        Before proceeding, it is always best to:
                        <ul>
                            <li> Verify an email is from a legitimate source. </li>
                            <p>
                                Banking Institutions, and other companies, will email from official email domains. 
                                If the email address looks fake, it might be! Contact the bank or company, or seek help, if needed.
                            </p>
                            <li> Look for 'Red Flags' </li>
                            <p>
                                Check for any spelling or grammar mistakes. Also, check for any messages which pressure you into doing something quickly or urgently.
                            </p>
                            <li> Hover your mouse / cursor over a link before clicking on it </li>
                            <p>
                                Hovering over a link will allow you to see where it goes. 
                                If this does not look like an official website, contact the company for help and/or open the website using a trusted method.
