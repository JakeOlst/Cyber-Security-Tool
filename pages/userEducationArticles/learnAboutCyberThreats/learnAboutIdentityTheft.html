                        <p> Identity Theft is a very serious crime in which a criminal uses another person's personal information. 
                            A criminal can use their name, banking details and other details, typically for financial gain.

                        <p> Let's explore a scenario involving a pervasive online threat known as Identity Theft. </p>
                        <p>
                            Imagine you receive an email seemingly from your bank, alerting you to suspicious activity in your account that requires urgent attention.
                            As you inspect the email, notice that it:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Displays the bank's logo, creating a false sense of legitimacy. </li>
                            <li> Addresses you by your full name, adding a personal touch. </li>
                            <li> Lacks spelling or grammatical errors, enhancing its credibility. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Trusting the email's authenticity, you click on the provided link and land on a website that mirrors your bank's official site.
                            However, this is an Identity Theft attempt. Upon entering your details, the criminal gains access to your personal information for malicious purposes.
                        </p>
                        <h1> How did they trick you into clicking on this email? </h1>
                        <p>
                            Cybercriminals employ cunning tactics to make their emails appear genuine:
                            <ol>
                                <li> The email seems legitimate, addressing you by your full name and featuring the bank's logo. </li>
                                <li> The email creates a sense of urgency, claiming immediate attention is needed for your account. </li>
                                <li> Clicking on the link takes you to a website that convincingly mimics your bank's official site. </li>
                                <li> Unbeknownst to you, entering your details provides the criminal with sensitive information. </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <h1> You suspect you've fallen victim to an Identity Theft attempt. What should you do? </h1>
                        <p>
                            Stay calm and take these steps to address the situation:
                            <ol>
                                <li> Change any passwords you may have disclosed to the scammer. </li>
                                <li> Contact your bank using a trusted method to report the incident and seek guidance. </li>
                                <li> Don't be ashamed to share your experience with someone you trust and seek assistance if needed. </li>
                                <li> Keep a close eye on your accounts for any suspicious activity and promptly report it. </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="section">
                        <h1 id="section5"> How could we have avoided this? </h1>
                        <p>
                            Before proceeding, it is always best to:
                            <ul>
                                <li> Verify an email is from a legitimate source. </li>
                                <p>
                                    Banking Institutions, and other companies, will email from official email domains. 
                                    If the email address looks fake, it might be! Contact the bank or company, or seek help, if needed.
                                </p>
                                <li> Look for 'Red Flags' </li>
                                <p>
                                    Check for any spelling or grammar mistakes. Also, check for any messages which pressure you into doing something quickly or urgently.
                                </p>
                                <li> Hover your mouse / cursor over a link before clicking on it </li>
                                <p>
                                    Hovering over a link will allow you to see where it goes. 
                                    If this does not look like an official website, contact the company for help and/or open the website using a trusted method.
                                </p>
