                            Cyber threats are increasingly prevalent, causing financial, emotional, and physical harm. 
                            To counter these risks, companies have developed tools to prevent and mitigate these threats. 
                            One such tool is a Firewall, designed to prevent unauthorized access and protect your network from potential security breaches.
